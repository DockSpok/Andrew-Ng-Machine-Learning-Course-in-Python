# Andrew Ng's famous Machine Learning Course in Python

## About
While taking Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning course on Coursera,](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) I decided to complete all the programming assignments in Python, as I believe that is the best language for machine learning. I have organized my work into folders that correspond to the specific week each programming assignment was assigned. Each folder contains the python code, the assignment pdf, as well as the files necessary to run the code (typically .txt, .mat, and .csv files). The code for each assignment reproduces all the expected results, including all visualizations and even the optional parts. Feel free to use the code while you take the course, or use this repo as a point of reference. Let me know if you find any bugs, or want to contribute and change some of the code (which is not perfect by any stretch, so this would be much appreciated!).
